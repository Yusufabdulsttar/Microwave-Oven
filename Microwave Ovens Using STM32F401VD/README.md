# Microwave designed using PIC Microcontroller and simulated in Proteus
### In this project, I used the driver that I implemented for the PIC18F4620 microcontroller. This driver allowed me to control the following devices: LCD, LED, Keypad, BUSH_BUTTON, DC motor, Timers, Interrupt, and GPIO.
### I used the timer to trigger an interrupt every 1 second 
### There are the steps to run a microwave oven : 
- ### Open the door. The light inside the microwave will turn on.
- ### Put the food in the microwave. The food sensor will sense the food.
- ### Close the door. You cannot set the time when the door is open.
- ### If there is a food in the microwave, you can set the time from 0 to 99 minutes. To do this, enter the desired cooking time using the keypad.
- ### Press the Start button. The microwave will start cooking the food and display the remaining time.
- ### To add more food or change the cooking time, press the Stop button once, make your changes, and press Start, The microwave will continue cooking from where it left off.
- ### To turn off the microwave, press the Stop button Two times one after the other.
